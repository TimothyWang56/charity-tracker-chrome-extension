# Give Your Two Cents
Give Your Two Cents is a Chrome extension that helps break down the two largest barriers to donating: saving up funds and finding a charity to donate to. By having users pledge a few cents when making an online purchase, they can accumulate funds until they have reached their goal. We have users pledge the cents needed to round up the total cost of their online purchase to the dollar. For example, if a user is purchasing an item on Amazon for $30.59, they would pledge $0.41 to their saved balance. Once they have pledged $10 total, they can start looking for charities to donate their accumulated balance to. We give recommendations of reputable charities that the user can select from, but the user is free to choose whichever charity they feel most strongly in donating to. Once the user has donated their money, they can log it in our extension. We keep track of the user’s total amount donated and a record of their history so they can see the impact they’ve made.
